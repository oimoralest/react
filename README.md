# Working with Fragments, Portals and Refs

## Description

In this project I have learned to solve the following problems:

- JSX Limitations. Solved with Fragments
- Getting a cleaner code. Solved with Portals

Also I have learned to work with Refs

## References

- JSX Limitations:

  - You can't return more than one "root" JSX element (You also can't store more than one "root" JSX element in a variable) because you can return multiple values on JS

- [Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html)
